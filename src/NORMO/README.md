# NORMO

## SOURCE
NORMO: a new heuristic for estimating the number of components in CP tensor decomposition
Sofia Fernandes, Hadi Fanaee-T and Jo√£o Gama

## DESCRIPTION
MATLAB implementation of NORMO, a new method for estimating the number of components in CP tensor decomposition   

This implementation assumes that the tensor is 3 dimensional (but adaptations to other dimensions may be made 
available upon request).

## FILES
For illustration purposes we provide a demo file (demo.m) in which we apply our method - NORMO - to one of the
synthetic datasets.
	
## DEPENDECIES
Our code makes use of the n-way matlab toolbox, which is available at: 
	http://www.models.life.ku.dk/nwaytoolbox/download
