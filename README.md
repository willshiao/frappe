There are three directories:

- `python` contains the Python code for FRAPPE and Self-FRAPPE.
- `src` contains the MATLAB code for the baseline methods
- `data` stores the downloaded and generated datasets.

Please refer to the `README.md` file in each of the respective directories for more information.
